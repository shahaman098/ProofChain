# TrustChain Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

The TrustChain Smart Contract is a custom Algorand smart contract designed specifically for handling hate incident reports in a decentralized, transparent, and immutable manner. This contract was built from scratch using PyTeal to meet the unique requirements of the TrustChain reporting platform.

## Contract Features

### ‚úÖ Custom Implementation
- **Built from scratch** using PyTeal (Python framework for Algorand smart contracts)
- **Not a boilerplate or copied contract** - designed specifically for hate incident reporting
- **Unique functionality** tailored to social impact reporting needs

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents spam by limiting reports to 1 per minute per user
- **Input validation**: Ensures report data is valid and within size limits (max 1KB)
- **Sender validation**: Prevents zero-address transactions
- **Anti-tampering**: Immutable record storage on blockchain

### üìä State Management
- **Global State**: Tracks total reports and contract version
- **Local State**: Tracks individual user report counts and timestamps
- **Opt-in mechanism**: Users must opt-in to use local state storage

## Technical Specifications

### Contract Address and Deployment
- **Network**: Algorand TestNet
- **App ID**: (Will be updated after deployment)
- **Language**: PyTeal (Python)
- **TEAL Version**: 8 (Latest)

### State Schema
```python
# Global State Schema
global_schema = StateSchema(
    num_uints=2,        # total_reports, (version stored as bytes)
    num_byte_slices=2   # contract_version
)

# Local State Schema  
local_schema = StateSchema(
    num_uints=2,        # user_report_count, last_report_time
    num_byte_slices=0   # No local byte storage needed
)
```

### Application Arguments
The contract accepts the following application arguments:

1. **Method Name** (Bytes): The operation to perform
   - `"submit_report"`: Submit a new incident report
   - `"get_stats"`: Retrieve contract statistics

2. **Report Data** (Bytes): The incident report content
   - Contains incident description, metadata, and references
   - Support for police reference numbers
   - IPFS CID linking for evidence files
   - Anonymous reporting flags

## Smart Contract Functions

### 1. Initialize Contract (`on_create`)
```python
def initialize_contract():
    # Set initial global state
    App.globalPut("total_reports", Int(0))
    App.globalPut("version", Bytes("1.0.0"))
    return Int(1)
```

**Purpose**: Initializes the contract when first deployed
**Global State Changes**: 
- Sets `total_reports` to 0
- Sets contract `version` to "1.0.0"

### 2. User Opt-In (`on_opt_in`)
```python
on_opt_in = Seq([
    App.localPut(Txn.sender(), "user_reports", Int(0)),
    App.localPut(Txn.sender(), "last_report", Int(0)),
    Int(1)
])
```

**Purpose**: Allows users to opt-in to use the contract
**Local State Changes**:
- Sets user's `user_reports` count to 0
- Sets user's `last_report` timestamp to 0

### 3. Submit Report (`submit_report`)
```python
def submit_report():
    # Validation checks
    sender_validation = Txn.sender() != Global.zero_address()
    rate_limit_check = time_since_last_report >= Int(60)  # 1 minute
    report_data_validation = Len(report_data_arg) > Int(0)
    report_size_check = Len(report_data_arg) <= Int(1000)  # Max 1KB
    
    # State updates
    # Increment global report counter
    # Update user's report count and timestamp
    # Log report to transaction log
```

**Purpose**: Submit a new hate incident report
**Validations**:
- ‚úÖ Sender is not zero address
- ‚úÖ At least 60 seconds since user's last report (anti-spam)
- ‚úÖ Report data is not empty
- ‚úÖ Report data is within size limit (1KB)

**State Changes**:
- Increments global `total_reports` counter
- Increments user's `user_reports` count
- Updates user's `last_report` timestamp
- **Logs report data** to blockchain transaction log for permanent storage

### 4. Get Statistics (`get_stats`)
```python
def get_stats():
    Log(Concat(
        Bytes("STATS:"),
        Bytes("total_reports:"),
        Itob(App.globalGet("total_reports")),
        Bytes(":version:"),
        App.globalGet("version")
    ))
    return Int(1)
```

**Purpose**: Retrieve contract usage statistics
**Returns**: Logs statistics to transaction log

## Why This Contract is Unique

### 1. Social Impact Focus
Unlike generic smart contracts, this contract is specifically designed for:
- **Hate incident reporting** with specialized metadata handling
- **Anonymous reporting support** through optional sender masking
- **Evidence linking** via IPFS CID storage
- **Police integration** through reference number fields

### 2. Anti-Abuse Mechanisms
- **Rate limiting** prevents spam attacks
- **Size limits** prevent blockchain bloat
- **Validation checks** ensure data integrity

### 3. Transparency and Auditability
- **Public statistics** accessible to anyone
- **Immutable logs** stored in transaction history
- **Open-source code** for community verification

### 4. Privacy-Preserving Design
- Supports **anonymous reporting** when needed
- **Minimal data storage** on-chain (large files stored on IPFS)
- **User opt-in** required for local state usage

## Integration with TrustChain Frontend

### JavaScript/TypeScript Integration
```typescript
// Example frontend integration
import algosdk from 'algosdk';

const submitReport = async (reportData: string) => {
  const appArgs = [
    new Uint8Array(Buffer.from("submit_report")),
    new Uint8Array(Buffer.from(reportData))
  ];
  
  const txn = algosdk.makeApplicationNoOpTxnFromObject({
    sender: userAddress,
    suggestedParams: params,
    appIndex: APP_ID,
    appArgs: appArgs,
  });
  
  // Sign and submit transaction...
};
```

### Report Data Format
The contract accepts structured report data containing:
```
Report Message: "Incident description..."
[DATE:2025-10-19T10:30:00.000Z]
[POLICE_REF:REF123456]  
[EVIDENCE:QmXXXXXXIPFSCID]
[ANONYMOUS:true]
```
