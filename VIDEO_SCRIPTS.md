## ðŸŽ¥ Video Recording Scripts

### **1. Technical Walkthrough Video Script (10-12 minutes)**

#### **Introduction (1 minute)**
```
"Hi, I'm demonstrating ProofChain, a decentralized hate incident reporting platform built on Algorand blockchain for the Algorand Hackathon.

ProofChain solves the critical problem of hate crime underreporting by providing a secure, anonymous platform where community members can document incidents with blockchain-verified integrity."
```

#### **Problem & Solution (2 minutes)**  
```
"Hate crimes are significantly underreported due to fear, distrust of authorities, and lack of secure reporting mechanisms. ProofChain addresses this by:

1. Enabling anonymous reporting with no identity exposure
2. Using blockchain immutability for tamper-proof records  
3. Supporting IPFS evidence storage for multimedia proof
4. Providing transparent community statistics for advocacy

The Algorand blockchain is perfect for this because of its low fees, fast finality, and advanced features like box storage."
```

#### **Technical Architecture Demo (4 minutes)**
```
"Let me show you the technical implementation:

[Screen: Open VS Code with contract code]

Our custom PyTeal smart contract has three main methods:

1. submit_report() - Takes incident details and stores them securely
2. get_report() - Retrieves reports by ID for verification  
3. get_stats() - Provides community analytics

[Screen: Show artifacts directory]

The AlgoKit build system generates TEAL artifacts: approval program, clear state, and ABI specification.

[Screen: Terminal deployment]

Our deployment script connects to TestNet and creates the contract with proper validation."
```

#### **Frontend Integration (2 minutes)**
```
"The React frontend integrates with Algorand through Pera Wallet:

[Screen: Show frontend interface]

Users can connect their wallet, submit reports with evidence links, and view community statistics. The interface is designed for ease of use while maintaining security.

All interactions are signed transactions, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation."
```

#### **Live Demonstration (2 minutes)**
```
"Let me demonstrate a live report submission:

First, I'll deploy the contract to TestNet... 
[Show deployment output]

Now I'll submit a test report...
[Show contract call]

And verify it on the block explorer...
[Show AlgoExplorer]

The report is now permanently stored on Algorand with cryptographic integrity."
```

#### **Closing (1 minute)**
```
"ProofChain demonstrates Algorand's potential for social impact applications. The combination of low fees, advanced smart contract features, and developer-friendly tools like AlgoKit make it ideal for civic technology.

The complete source code, documentation, and deployment instructions are available in the GitHub repository. Thank you for watching!"
```

### **2. Demo Video Script (5-7 minutes)**

#### **Quick Demo Flow**
```
1. "Welcome to ProofChain" - Show landing page
2. "Connect Wallet" - Pera Wallet integration demo
3. "Submit Report" - Fill out incident form with sample data  
4. "Blockchain Confirmation" - Show transaction processing
5. "View on Explorer" - Navigate to TestNet block explorer
6. "Community Stats" - Display aggregated analytics
7. "Privacy Protection" - Explain anonymous reporting features
```

#### **Key Talking Points**
